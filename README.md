This is the base themefile that I use for wordpress, it's built to work pretty quick in my environment, so it's a little (insanely) opinionated. What you see here is a conglomeration of all of the sweet tools I've gathered over the years and I'm finally putting them in a repo. Hopefully it will be updated more than a yearly basis.

#### Makes use of / relies on / I love everyone who worked on:
- [@JaredNova's](http://twitter.com/jarednova) plugin to support twig: [Timber Library](https://github.com/jarednova/timber) it's not in this repo, but it's useless w/o it
- A hodge-podge of [Upstatement's Timber Startup Library](https://github.com/upstatement/timber-starter-theme) and [Themble's Bones](http://themble.com/bones/)
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [The 7-1 Sass Pattern](http://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern) that [Hugo Giraudel](http://hugogiraudel.com/) wrote about in [sass-guidelin.es](http://sass-guidelin.es)
- Grunt
- [Thoughtbot's](https://github.com/thoughtbot):
	- [Bourbon](bourbon.io) and
	- [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/)

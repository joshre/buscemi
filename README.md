# Buscemi
![Buscemi](buscemi.png)

This is the base themefile that I use for wordpress, it's built to work pretty quick in my environment, so it's a little (insanely) opinionated. What you see here is a conglomeration of all of the sweet tools I've gathered over the years and put  in a repo. Usually when starting a new project, I make whatever changes I've made in ongoing projects  and commit them here.

##### Note
This is probably unusable for anyone but myself, i think, idk.
